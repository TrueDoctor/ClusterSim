# ClusterSim

The Goal of ClusterSim is, to provide an expendable framework to simulate and analyse n-Body Problems. 
- Multiple Integration-algoritms are available to choose from
- Various algorithms to speed-up computation have been implemented
- Distribute copmutational load to multiple computers via server and client application
- Results are saved in an Sql database

## Also included
- A simple desktop application to organize simulated starclusters
- ### Dataview - Visualisation
  - realistic depiction of starclusters as tow dimensional projection
  - various tow and three dimensional plots via interfacing with Gnuplot
